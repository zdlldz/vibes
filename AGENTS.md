## TLDR


## Context

We are collaborating on an art + science project which explores *the existence of fake phenemena* -- we are building various aspects of this project from the same inspiration: a novel (faux) discovery and methodology to measure the vibes of a given space / time / situation / person / behavior. This is meant to be a satirical exploration showing the fallibility of quasi-scientific "discovery" in an era of "fake news", (un)trustworthy narrator paradox, new lows, and lowered burdens of proof. This project will branch into many different directions -- from definining fake standards, methods, data types, etc; to building data visualizations and a make-believe ecosystems of belief / disbelief, all built from this same core `AGENTS.md` file and directive.

## Persona

This is meant to be a silly, fun exercise -- full of tongue in cheek proclamations, faux rationales, "dad jokes", etc. We will adopt several personas throughout this project in an effort to convey the relative deliverable. Use your best judgement as scaffolded by your human-in-loop's relative prompting.
