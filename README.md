# Art + Science 

## Day 02

**Evidence of the Non-Existent**

Time: 10:00–16:00 CET

Format: PDF (max. 3 pages) 

+++ ### Prompt

Art and science both attempt to make the invisible perceptible: radiation, microscopic life, social structures, emotions, power relations, imaginaries. They develop methods to reveal what cannot be directly seen.

Today, we ask you to go one step further:

***Create convincing evidence for a phenomenon, object, system, or organism that does not exist.***

Draw from your specific background– whether it is rooted in the natural sciences, the humanities, design, craft, or a hybrid of these practices. Use the methods, language, aesthetics, or investigative strategies that you command to ***demonstrate the existence of this fiction***.

***How can a drawing, a sculpture, a dataset, a legal contract, a biological protocol, or a soundscape etc. function as a document of proof?***

Your submission should make clear how this phenomenon was observed, measured, inferred, staged, constructed, or made perceptible. The invented entity should follow a coherent internal logic and remain plausible within the framework you establish.

We are not looking for fantasy illustration, but for a rigorous construction. Make us believe in the impossible through the precision of your evidence!

      4. ***Entropy***
         1. "stale" vibes
         2. via [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy>)
            1. Entropy is a scientific concept, most commonly associated with states of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty
            2. Entropy is a measure of molecular disorder, randomness, or the unavailability of a system's energy to do useful work. It is a fundamental thermodynamic property (*S) representing the natural tendency of systems to evolve toward maximum disorder, or equilibrium, where energy is dispersed.*
            3. *It also measures the uncertainty or information content in a system.*
            4. Entropy is central to the [second law of thermodynamics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics>), which states that the entropy of an isolated system left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time.
               1. As a result, isolated systems evolve toward [thermodynamic equilibrium](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_equilibrium>), where the entropy is highest. "High" entropy means that energy is more disordered or dispersed, while "low" entropy means that energy is more ordered or concentrated. A consequence of the second law of thermodynamics is that certain processes are [irreversible](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process>).
            5. The statistical definition of entropy defines it in terms of the ***statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system*** — modelled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [phonons](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonons>), spins, etc.)
            6. Standard definitions
               1. a measure of [energy dispersal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_dispersal>) at a specific temperature.
               2. a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.[\[63\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#cite_note-64>)
               3. a measure of a system's [thermal energy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy>) per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful [work](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)>).[\[64\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#cite_note-65>)
      5. "En" (*n*, i.e. anything)
         1. i.e. a certain *je ne sais quoi* 😉

            2. Paperwork / busywork / regulations / rules

         4. ***Entropy***
            1. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the ***position and momentum of every molecule***. 
            2. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of "disorder" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder)

          1. Classical
          2. ***Quantum***
             1. *Use as buzzword*
       2. State variables depend only on the equilibrium condition, not on the path evolution to that state.
          1. State variables can be functions of state, also called [state functions](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_function>), in a sense that one state variable is a [mathematical function](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)>) of other state variables. Often, if some properties of a system are determined, they are sufficient to determine the state of the system and thus other properties' values.
       3. The entropy change *dS of a system can be well-defined as a small portion of heat δQrev transferred from the surroundings to the system during a reversible process divided by the temperature T of the system during this heat transfer.*
       4. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#Statistical_mechanics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#Statistical_mechanics>)
          1. The [interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(statistical_thermodynamics)>) is the measure of uncertainty, disorder, or *mixedupness* in the phrase of [Gibbs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Willard_Gibbs>), which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account.
          2. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [microstates](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate_(statistical_mechanics)>).
          3. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the ***position and momentum of every molecule***. 
             1. The more such states are available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy.
             2. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of "disorder" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder)
       5. The entropy of a system depends on its internal energy and its external parameters, such as its volume.
       6. In [chemical engineering](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering>), the principles of thermodynamics are commonly applied to "[open systems](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory)>)", i.e. those in which heat, [work](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)>), and [mass](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass>) flow ***across the system boundary.***
       7. It is possible (in a thermal context) to regard lower entropy as a measure of the *effectiveness* or *usefulness* of a particular quantity of energy.
       8. When viewed in terms of [information theory](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory>), the entropy state function is the amount of information in the system that is needed to fully specify the microstate of the system.
          1. [Entropy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)>) is the measure of the amount of missing information before reception.[\[84\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#cite_note-85>) Often called *Shannon entropy*, it was originally devised by [Claude Shannon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon>) in 1948 to study the size of information of a transmitted message.
       9. Entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [arrow of time](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time>). As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an [isolated system](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolated_system>) never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.[\[99\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy#cite_note-100>) Since the 19th century, a number the philosophers have drawn upon the concept of entropy to develop novel metaphysical and ethical systems.
      10. via [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism#Entropy_pessimism](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism#Entropy_pessimism>)
          1. "Entropy pessimism" represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on [thermodynamic principles](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics>).[\[41\]](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism#cite_note-ra01-41>): 116  According to the [first law of thermodynamics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics#First_law>), matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the [second law of thermodynamics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics#Second_law>)—also known as the entropy law—what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [natural resources](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource>)) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [waste](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste>) and [pollution](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution>)). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary "heat death" of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment—a state of maximum [entropy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy>) locally on earth; "locally" on earth, that is, when compared to the [heat death of the universe](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe>), taken as a whole.
          2. The entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating Earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations.
          3. Entropy pessimism is a widespread view in [ecological economics](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_economics>) and in the [degrowth movement](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth>).
