# Scientists Have Finally Measured 'Vibes.' The D.M.V. Lost.

### A research team in Geneva spent a year taking a custom-built instrument to raves, dog parks, and government waiting rooms. Their findings, published this week in a peer-reviewed journal, confirm everything you already knew — and one thing you didn't.

On a Sunday afternoon last spring, a researcher from the University of Geneva stood at the edge of a dog park in São Paulo, Brazil, holding a device that looked, she would later admit, like "a very enthusiastic toaster." Around her, dogs sprinted after tennis balls, strangers exchanged numbers, and someone's golden retriever disrupted a birthday picnic with what witnesses described as excellent timing. The researcher, Dr. Anita Goodvibe, was not there to study the dogs. She was there to measure the vibe.

"It was a 0.797," she said, when I called her earlier this week. She said it the way a meteorologist announces a high of 74 degrees — with quiet, professional satisfaction.

Dr. Goodvibe is the lead author of a paper published Monday in the *Journal of Emergent Social Thermodynamics* that has done something scientists have gestured toward for years without quite managing: formally defined, measured, and ranked the vibe. The paper introduces the **VIBE index** — an acronym, it turns out, for Vibrations, Intimacy, Bureaucracy, and Entropy — and describes the VIBEMETER Mark II, a sixteen-channel field instrument developed by her team at the Centre for Atmospheric and Social Energetics (CASE) at the University of Geneva. Over the course of a year, the team took their device to nine social environments across four cities, collected 270 observations, and published the results.

The findings are, by turns, vindicating, counterintuitive, and, in at least one case, genuinely a little sad.

The VIBE index works like this: for any given environment, the VIBEMETER simultaneously measures four things. **Vibrations** — sound, light, air movement, micro-seismic activity, and a fifth, proprietary channel whose specifications are, per the paper, "withheld pending patent resolution." **Intimacy** — body heat, neurological coherence between co-present individuals, perspiration, breathing patterns, and what the paper calls the ratio of "words said" relative to "words unsaid," measured via contextual gap analysis of ambient speech. **Bureaucracy**, operationalized in reverse — a high score means low regulatory burden, i.e., a space where the rules are not actively suffocating you. And **Entropy** — the richness and complexity of the emotional and informational environment, including a self-reported measure that Dr. Goodvibe's team calls the Ennui Quotient, administered on-site to anyone willing to answer the question: *"How bleh do you feel right now?"*

The four scores are combined into a single composite number between zero and one. A perfect vibe is a 1.0. "Vibes were off" is, precisely, a 0.0. The math, the paper notes, involves a Gibbs-Boltzmann partition function and something called "social temperature," though Dr. Goodvibe is quick to offer the shorthand: it's the geometric mean of the four components, which means that any single score of zero drives the entire index to zero.

"There is no averaging your way out of a bad bureaucracy score," she said.

And so, to the results. At the top of the rankings: a rave, measured at 3:00 a.m., which scored a 0.866 — the highest mean VIBE in the study, distinguished from second place (a dog park on a Sunday afternoon, 0.797) primarily by its superior Vibrations score. Christmas dinner placed third, at 0.740, though the researchers were careful to note the highest standard deviation in the dataset, "reflecting the well-documented bimodal distribution of Christmas dinner emotional valence across cultures and family configurations." Which is a scientific way of saying: your mileage may vary.

At the bottom: the government waiting room, with a mean VIBE of 0.178. Its Bureaucracy score — 0.083, the lowest in the study — was, the paper states, "sufficient to destroy a vibe." The Monday morning remote standup fared nearly as poorly, at 0.272, distinguished from the library (0.242) only by slightly higher Entropy. Whatever is happening in your standup at 9 a.m., it is at least uncertain.

The finding that generated the most discussion at the lab, Dr. Goodvibe said, was the funeral reception, which placed fifth overall with a mean score of 0.534 — above the study midpoint. "Grief generates intimacy," she explained. "People embrace. They say things they have been meaning to say. The entropy is high — the situation is emotionally complex, full of feeling. Acoustically, yes, a funeral is quiet. But quiet is not the same as low-vibe." The paper notes, with characteristic understatement, that this result "is consistent with the informal observation that 'a good funeral' is a socially recognised phenomenon in many cultures."

Simone Lefebvre, 28, a graphic designer in Paris who read about the study on social media, said the funeral result surprised her initially but then didn't. "I went to my grandmother's funeral two years ago and it was one of the most connected I have felt to my family in years," she said. "I just didn't expect a scientist in Geneva to be able to put a number on it."

The number is 0.534.

There is also, buried on page four of the paper, a finding so quietly desolate it has become the one most cited on social media this week. In the government waiting room, amid all the fluorescent lighting and numbered tickets, something anomalous occurred: four observations recorded an Intimacy score between 0.532 and 0.699 — dramatically higher than the context average of 0.157. The researchers, reviewing their field notes, traced it to two strangers who, stuck in the same queue, began talking. They talked, apparently, for the full measurement window.

The paper designates this phenomenon **Bureaucracy-Induced Intimacy Surge**, or BIIS. "Extreme bureaucratic conditions," it reads, "may paradoxically catalyse intimacy through shared adversity." Dr. Goodvibe said she found it hopeful. "Even at a 0.083 on freedom from institutional constraint," she said, "humans will find each other."

James Okafor, 41, a project manager in London, said he immediately thought of his Monday standup. "I forwarded the paper to my manager," he said. "I highlighted the part about bureaucracy." He paused. "She replied with a calendar invite for a meeting about the paper."

Its Bureaucracy score has not been measured.

For those concerned about the vibe of their own environments, the paper offers a few data-driven conclusions. Dog parks are good — reliably, cross-culturally good, with low variance and a Bureaucracy score of 0.902. First dates (0.677) outperform most workplaces. Libraries are worse than funerals. And the conference keynote with a single attendee, which the CASE team measured in London, produced a finding the paper describes with admirable restraint: a scenario "in which vibes are technically generated but not received."

That one scored a 0.343.

Dr. Goodvibe said she hopes the research opens a broader conversation about how we design the spaces we inhabit. "We have building codes for air quality, for acoustics, for access," she said. "We do not have building codes for vibe. Perhaps we should." She is already planning a follow-up study. She wants to measure the VIBE half-life — how long it takes for any given environment's energy to decay toward a flat average, absent new input. She suspects, based on the entropy data, that the decline is both measurable and irreversible.

"It is consistent with thermodynamics," she said. "Unfortunately."

Back at the dog park in São Paulo — the one that scored nearly as high as a rave at 3 a.m. — Dr. Goodvibe had packed up the VIBEMETER and was watching the golden retriever, the one that had ruined the birthday picnic. It was now sitting very still next to its owner, looking up at her with an expression of complete and unselfconscious adoration.

"The dogs," she said, "are a significant contributor to the Intimacy score. We are not certain yet whether they generate the vibe or whether they detect it and amplify it." She thought about this for a moment. "Both possibilities," she added, "have significant implications."

The dog had no comment. Its Ennui Quotient was, by all available evidence, a one.

## Media Production Brief

*The following is an internal production guide for editors, photo desk, and video. Not for publication.*

---

### Hero Image
**Shot:** Dr. Anita Goodvibe (to be cast/styled) holding VIBEMETER Mark II prop in an outdoor park setting — Geneva aesthetic, leafy, European. Warm afternoon light. She should look earnest and slightly over-equipped — a scientist in the field, not a lab. The VIBEMETER should look credible: boxy, with multiple sensor protrusions, branded. A lanyard or carrying case would help.
**Mood:** Science meets street photography. Think NatGeo meets a tech product launch.
**Photographer:** Assign Geneva-based stringer.

### Video 1: Explainer — "Can Science Measure a Vibe? A Geneva Lab Says Yes."
**Format:** Documentary-style, 2–3 minutes.
**Structure:**
1. Open on the VIBEMETER in a case — Dr. Goodvibe opening it, checking sensors (0:00–0:20)
2. Walk-and-talk through the VIBE model — each component explained on-camera with b-roll cutaways (0:20–1:20)
3. Field deployment sequence — Dr. Goodvibe (or co-author Bration) operating the VIBEMETER in a public space (1:20–2:00)
4. Screen capture / animation of the data being recorded and scored (2:00–2:30)
5. Closing line to camera (2:30–2:47)
**B-roll needed:** lab interior, sensor close-ups, public spaces, data readouts on laptop screen
**Tone:** Straight. No irony. The scientists should appear to take this completely seriously.

---

### Video 2: Field Footage — "Inside the Rave That Scored 0.866"
**Format:** Raw/observational, 60–90 seconds. No narration.
**Content:** Dimly lit venue, crowd, lights, VIBEMETER visible in foreground being operated by a researcher. No faces of venue-goers to be shown. Score readout to appear on-screen at end: **0.866**.
**Note:** Can be staged at any large venue. The authenticity is in the data on-screen, not the footage itself.

### Infographic: VIBE Rankings
**Format:** Horizontal bar chart. Clean, editorial design consistent with NYT graphics style.
**Data (use exactly):**

| Context | VIBE Score |
|---------|------------|
| Rave, 3:00am | 0.866 |
| Dog park, Sunday afternoon | 0.797 |
| Christmas dinner | 0.740 |
| First date (restaurant) | 0.677 |

### Photo: Government Waiting Room
**Shot:** Interior of a bureaucratic waiting room — numbered ticket dispenser, plastic chairs in a row, fluorescent overhead lighting, blank-expression subjects (or empty room). The VIBEMETER should not appear in this photo — this is the "before" state, not the study itself.
**Mood:** Flat. Institutional. The visual equivalent of 0.178.
**Caption:** "A government waiting room at a public administrative office in Tokyo, one of the four field sites in the study. The VIBEMETER recorded a Bureaucracy score of 0.083 here — the lowest in the entire dataset."

---

### Photo: Dog Park
**Shot:** Golden hour, a busy dog park — dogs running, owners laughing, a general feeling of unstructured joy. Wide angle preferred.
**Mood:** Everything the government waiting room is not.
**Caption:** "The dog park in São Paulo's Parque Ibirapuera, recorded as Context 6 in the study. Mean VIBE: 0.797."
**Note:** The golden retriever referenced in the article lede is a nice tie-back if the shot can be staged to include one.
