# Planning

- **Slice 1:** quick sanity check on recent NYTimez and quiz work.
- **Slice 2:** upgrade quiz controls with playful labels + active chip state.
- **Slice 3:** increase visual emphasis of center quiz panel versus ad rails.
- **Slice 4:** refactor `vibe-con.org` home into a ticket-forward landing page.
- **Slice 5:** refactor `vibe-con.org` program pages into conference-style schedule + speaker rails.
- **Slice 6:** run lint/reference checks and capture concise docs updates.
