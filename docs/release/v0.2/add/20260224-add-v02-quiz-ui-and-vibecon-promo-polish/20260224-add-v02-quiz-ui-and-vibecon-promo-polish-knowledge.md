# Knowledge

- The quiz feels more app-like when quick-pick controls have explicit active state feedback tied to slider changes.
- Increasing visual separation between center action panel and side ads improves scanability and perceived primary task.
- Conference landing conversion improves with:
  - ticket tiers
  - clear pricing callouts
  - featured speakers
  - timeline/session previews
  - repeated CTA placement
- Program pages read as more “real conference” when schedule rows include time, title, and plain-language value proposition.
