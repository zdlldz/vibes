# Todo Next

- Run visual QA snapshots for desktop/mobile on:
  - `vibe-con.org/index-v2.html`
  - `vibe-con.org/program-v2.html`
- Add simple ticket “urgency” states (sold out, low inventory) as controlled UI variants.
- Add 1-2 additional speaker profiles with distinct imagery and bios.
- Consider wiring “Buy Tickets” CTA to a dedicated fake checkout flow page.
