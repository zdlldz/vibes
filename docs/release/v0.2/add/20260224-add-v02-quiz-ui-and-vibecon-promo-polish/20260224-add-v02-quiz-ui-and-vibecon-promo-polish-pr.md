# PR Notes

- Enhanced `testyourvibes` v2 UI with playful button language, emoji labels, active chip states, and stronger center-panel hierarchy.
- Rebuilt `vibe-con.org` home + program pages (v1/v2) into destination-style conference pages with ticket-forward messaging.
- Added conference conversion structures:
  - hero + pricing callout
  - ticket tiers
  - featured speaker cards
  - day timeline
  - workshop/knockout session grids
- Preserved global disclaimer and local/remote resolver behavior.
