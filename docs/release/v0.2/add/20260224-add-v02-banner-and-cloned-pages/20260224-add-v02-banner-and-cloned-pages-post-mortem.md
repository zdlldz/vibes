# Post-mortem

## What worked
- Scripted approach prevented drift and saved time across 24 output files.

## Risks
- v0.2 link rewrites are heuristic; future custom routes may need explicit mapping additions.

## Follow-up
- Consider adding worker pretty routes for v0.2 pages if cleaner URLs are desired.
