# PR Notes

## Scope
- Added standardized banner to all v0.1 pages.
- Added v0.2 cloned pages for every existing page.
- Added v0.2 link rewrites in cloned pages only.
- Added v0.2 docs bundle.

## Review tips
- Compare one site pair (`index.html` vs `index-v2.html`) to confirm rewrite logic.
- Spot-check cross-domain v0.2 links in banner.
