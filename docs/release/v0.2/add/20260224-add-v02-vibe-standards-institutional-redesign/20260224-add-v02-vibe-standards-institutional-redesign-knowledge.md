# Knowledge

- Institutional credibility increases when standards pages prioritize governance language, document control framing, and conformance pathways.
- A conservative visual treatment is achieved by restrained palette, serif typography, strong topbar hierarchy, and formal call-to-action phrasing.
- Cross-linking research + media + standards in one hub improves ecosystem legibility for reviewers and external readers.
- A dedicated placeholder page enables low-risk ingestion of upcoming long-form specification content.
