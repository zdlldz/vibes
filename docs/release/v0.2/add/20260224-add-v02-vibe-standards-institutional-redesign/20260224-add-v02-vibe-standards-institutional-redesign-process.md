# Process

- [x] Ran quick sanity check on prior work (lint + references).
- [x] Rebuilt `vibe-standards.org/index-v2.html` to a conservative institutional landing style.
- [x] Rebuilt `vibe-standards.org/vsc-0001-v2.html` with stronger normative and governance framing.
- [x] Added `vibe-standards.org/technical-specifications-v2.html` as a structured placeholder workspace.
- [x] Added explicit cross-links to NYTimez coverage and arXivz article pages (HTML/PDF).
- [x] Merged V1 standards-library depth back into `index-v2.html` (library table, certification/accreditation detail, public register snapshot, notices/circulars, FAQ) while preserving the new conservative v2 visual system.
- [x] Merged updated content from `www/vibe-standards.org/source-v2` into live v2 pages (`index-v2.html`, `vsc-0001-v2.html`) without replacing established v2 layout, style system, resolver wiring, or ecosystem links.
- [x] Completed a clause-depth follow-up merge on `vsc-0001-v2.html` (verbal forms key, stronger scope notes, and colloquial anchor table) from `source-v2` content while preserving current v2 design language and page architecture.
- [x] Added a compact Annex A/B/C preview strip to `vsc-0001-v2.html` (reference scores, B-inversion rationale, EQ instrument canonical question) to increase standards-document depth while keeping the page readable.
- [x] Final production polish pass: renamed organization line to "INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION FOR VIBE STANDARDS", removed all `placeholder` copy from v2 standards pages, added polished VIBE-CON banners above-the-fold and pre-footer, and re-audited copy/UI/UX/link wiring across `index-v2.html`, `vsc-0001-v2.html`, and `technical-specifications-v2.html`.
- [x] Re-ran lint + relative reference checks; no blockers.
