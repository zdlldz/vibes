# Process

- [x] Ran quick sanity check on prior work (lint + references).
- [x] Rebuilt `vibe-standards.org/index-v2.html` to a conservative institutional landing style.
- [x] Rebuilt `vibe-standards.org/vsc-0001-v2.html` with stronger normative and governance framing.
- [x] Added `vibe-standards.org/technical-specifications-v2.html` as a structured placeholder workspace.
- [x] Added explicit cross-links to NYTimez coverage and arXivz article pages (HTML/PDF).
- [x] Merged V1 standards-library depth back into `index-v2.html` (library table, certification/accreditation detail, public register snapshot, notices/circulars, FAQ) while preserving the new conservative v2 visual system.
- [x] Re-ran lint + relative reference checks; no blockers.
