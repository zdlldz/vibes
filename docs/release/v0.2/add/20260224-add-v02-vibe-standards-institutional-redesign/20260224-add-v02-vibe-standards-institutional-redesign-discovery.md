description: Discovery notes for conservative institutional redesign of vibe-standards v2.

# Discovery

- Existing standards pages were functional but visually close to other sites and not institutionally distinct.
- The user requested a conservative think-tank / standards-body tone with stronger promotion of the standard itself.
- Cross-linking to NYTimez coverage and arXivz article assets needed first-class placement.
- A placeholder framework was required for an upcoming detailed specification document.
