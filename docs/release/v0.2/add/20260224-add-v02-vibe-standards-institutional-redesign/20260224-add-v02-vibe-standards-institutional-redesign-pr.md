# PR Notes

- Full v2 redesign of `vibe-standards.org` main and standards excerpt pages with conservative institutional identity.
- Added a new v2 subpage scaffold for upcoming full technical specification content.
- Integrated cross-site evidence links to NYTimez article and arXivz landing/HTML/PDF artifacts.
- Preserved existing v2 disclaimer and environment-aware all-sites resolver behavior.
