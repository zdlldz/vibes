# PM Notes

- Delivered scope: v2 redesign for standards home + standard excerpt, plus new technical specification placeholder subpage.
- Integration scope met: cross-linking to NYTimez and arXivz article assets completed.
- Quality gates: lint clean, relative references valid, no deployment-facing blockers observed for static asset delivery.
