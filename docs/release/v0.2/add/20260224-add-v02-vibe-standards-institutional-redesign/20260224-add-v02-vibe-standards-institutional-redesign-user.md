# User Notes

- `vibe-standards.org` v2 now presents as a conservative institutional standards body.
- Standards promotion is now foregrounded with clearer featured-standard and conformance sections.
- External ecosystem references (NYTimez, arXivz, PDF/HTML article assets) are integrated as formal briefings.
- A dedicated technical specification placeholder is ready for your full detailed standard text.
