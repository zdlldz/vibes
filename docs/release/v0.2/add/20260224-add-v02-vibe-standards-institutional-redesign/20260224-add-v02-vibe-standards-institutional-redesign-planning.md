# Planning

- Rebuild `index-v2.html` with conservative institutional visual language and stronger standards promotion.
- Rebuild `vsc-0001-v2.html` as formal normative excerpt with governance framing.
- Add `technical-specifications-v2.html` placeholder for full upcoming specification package.
- Wire external evidence links (NYTimez article, arXivz landing, HTML/PDF article assets).
- Validate links/media/lint and document the release slice concisely.
