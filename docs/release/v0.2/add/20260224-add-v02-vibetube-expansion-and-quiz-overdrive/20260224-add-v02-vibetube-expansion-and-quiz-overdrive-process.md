# Process

- [x] Created docs bundle
- [x] Added `watch-news-clip-05-v2.html` and `watch-news-clip-06-v2.html`
- [x] Linked new clip pages in `vibetube` feed + watch page
- [x] Added button-based quick-pick controls + randomizer in `testyourvibes` v2
- [x] Added additional landscape ads + two autoplay looping ad videos
- [x] Ran media reference and lint checks
- [x] Polished `www/vibetube.art/index-v2.html` to mirror denser YouTube-style homepage composition (topic chips, expanded grid, shorts shelf)
- [x] Added additional clip inventory cards using existing domain-local thumbnails to increase feed density
- [x] Added quiz-sponsored ad placements across `vibetube` v2 homepage and watch page (`watch-vibecon-keynote-v2.html`)
- [x] Refined watch-page right rail to better match reference style (sponsored unit + topic chips + larger up-next stack)
- [x] Upgraded all remaining clip watch pages (`watch-news-clip-01-v2.html`, `watch-news-clip-02-v2.html`, `watch-news-clip-04-v2.html`, `watch-news-clip-05-v2.html`, `watch-news-clip-06-v2.html`) to the denser watch-page layout
- [x] Added quiz-sponsored units to all clip pages (inline module + right-rail sponsored video) while preserving video playback policy
