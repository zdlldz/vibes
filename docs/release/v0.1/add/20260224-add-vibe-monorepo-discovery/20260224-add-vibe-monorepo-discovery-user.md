# VIBE Web Ecosystem v0.1

## Overview
This project creates a believable network of parody websites that "prove" the existence of vibes through documents, data, and media artifacts.

## Getting Started
1. Open one domain folder under `www/`.
2. Start with `index.html`.
3. Navigate to flat HTML subpages that deepen the evidence narrative.
4. Use each domain's worker config in `workers/<domain>/` when preparing Cloudflare deployment.

## Key Capabilities
- **Standalone Sites:** Each domain runs independently with its own worker config.
- **Mimic Realism:** Core domains now include v2 front-end styling that resembles their source references.
- **Media Ready:** Every domain includes explicit placeholders for upcoming images/video/data visuals.
- **Traceable Evolution:** The docs trail records why each change exists.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Q:** Why are pages plain HTML instead of a JS framework?
- **A:** v0.1 prioritizes transparent artifacts and easy deployment over build complexity.
- **Q:** Are final images and videos included yet?
- **A:** Not yet. The current pages intentionally use placeholder modules so assets can be added quickly in a later step.
