# VIBE Web Ecosystem v0.1

## Overview
This project creates a believable network of parody websites that "prove" the existence of vibes through documents, data, and media artifacts.

## Getting Started
1. Open one domain folder under `www/`.
2. Start with `index.html`.
3. Navigate to flat HTML subpages that deepen the evidence narrative.

## Key Capabilities
- **Standalone Sites:** Each domain can run independently on its own worker.
- **Shared Mythology:** Every site contributes a different type of "proof."
- **Traceable Evolution:** The docs trail records why each change exists.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- **Q:** Why are pages plain HTML instead of a JS framework?
- **A:** v0.1 prioritizes transparent artifacts and easy deployment over build complexity.
