# Phase 7: To-Do Next

## Immediate Follow-ups
- [ ] Scaffold `arxivz.org` static pages and worker end-to-end.
- [ ] Create missing `www/vibetube.com` directory baseline.
- [ ] Establish worker naming convention for all planned domains.

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] Build `nytimez.art` as second domain using the same flat-page model.
- [ ] Add cross-domain linking phase once all six domains have baseline shells.
- [ ] Add lightweight automated checks for route/file parity across domains.
