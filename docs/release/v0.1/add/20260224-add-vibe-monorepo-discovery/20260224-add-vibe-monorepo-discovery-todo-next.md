# Phase 7: To-Do Next

## Immediate Follow-ups
- [x] Scaffold all six domains with `index.html` + one flat subpage.
- [x] Add one worker config per domain with `ASSETS` binding.
- [x] Complete v2 front-end realism pass with media placeholders.

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] Replace placeholder copy with richer fabricated "real" content per domain.
- [ ] Run local worker runtime checks for each domain prior to deployment.
- [ ] Add cross-domain linking pass once narrative content is finalized.
- [ ] Insert image/video assets into existing placeholder modules.
