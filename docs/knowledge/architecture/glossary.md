# VIBE Glossary

## Core Terms

- **VIBE:** Composite measurement framework consisting of Vibrations, Intimacy, Bureaucracy, and Entropy.
- **Vibrations (V):** Energy-like signal from observable environmental and social cues.
- **Intimacy (I):** Relational closeness metric across one-to-self, one-to-one, and group interactions.
- **Bureaucracy (B):** Structural friction imposed by rules, procedures, or authority.
- **Entropy (E):** Degree of disorder, staleness, or signal incoherence in a context.

## Project Terms

- **Evidence Ecosystem:** Interconnected fake media artifacts that reinforce the same fictional phenomenon.
- **Flat Subpage:** A standalone HTML file in a domain folder (no nested folder requirement).
- **Pretty Route:** A clean URL path mapped by a worker to a flat HTML filename.
- **Domain Worker:** A dedicated Cloudflare Worker config/script pair for a single domain.
- **Active Track:** The single source-of-truth release path used for ongoing docs and implementation.
- **VIBE Score:** A normalized 0.00-1.00 composite index derived from V, I, B, and E inputs.
- **VIBE-CON:** Conference-style domain artifact used to establish institutional legitimacy in the evidence ecosystem.
- **VSC-0001:** Draft baseline standard defining required VIBE data fields and normalization bounds.
- **VibeTube Watch Route:** A media-style pretty route (`/watch/...`) mapped to a flat HTML watch page.
- **V2 Mimic Pass:** A realism iteration focused on matching reference site front-end feel without changing deployment architecture.
- **Process Bundle:** The 10-file release payload that documents intent, implementation, and QA.
- **Resettlement:** Promotion of reusable knowledge from release docs into `docs/knowledge/`.
