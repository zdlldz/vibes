### Foreword

This second edition of IOVS 1001 cancels and replaces the first edition (IOVS 1001:2023), which has been technically revised. The principal changes are as follows:

- Clause 3 (Terms and Definitions): addition of terms 3.9 (social temperature), 3.10 (VIBE Hamiltonian), and 3.11 (anti-VIBE state)
- Clause 5 (VIBE Index Components): revised definition of the Entropy sub-index (E) to incorporate the Ennui Quotient (EQ) instrument
- Clause 6 (Composite Scoring): full analytical expression added as normative text; geometric mean approximation retained as informative note
- Annex A (Reference Contexts): updated to reflect findings of Goodvibe et al. (2026)

---

### 1. Scope

This document specifies:

a) the definition of the Vibrational-Intimate-Bureaucratic-Entropic (VIBE) index as a composite scalar measure of the affective-thermodynamic state of a social environment;

b) the four sub-indices comprising the VIBE index (Vibrations, Intimacy, Bureaucracy, Entropy) and their respective measurement domains;

c) the units of measurement, normalisation conventions, and range constraints for each sub-index and for the composite VIBE score;

d) the reference formula for computing the composite VIBE score from sub-index values;

e) the colloquial reference anchors against which VIBE scores SHALL be calibrated.

This document does not specify instrument performance requirements (see IOVS 1002) or field measurement methodology (see IOVS 1003).

---

### 2. Normative References

The following documents are referred to in the text in such a way that some or all of their content constitutes requirements of this document:

### 3. Terms and Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply:

**3.1 vibe**
The composite affective-thermodynamic state of a social environment at a given moment in time, as quantified by the VIBE index (3.4). Colloquially: "the vibe."

**3.2 social environment**
Any bounded space, situation, or temporal context in which one or more persons are co-present, whether physically or mediated by technology.

**3.3 sub-index**
Any one of the four component measures — Vibrations (V), Intimacy (I), Bureaucracy (B), or Entropy (E) — whose values, in combination, determine the composite VIBE score.

**3.4 VIBE index**
The composite scalar quantity, denoted VIBE, representing the aggregate affective-thermodynamic state of a social environment. Computed as specified in Clause 6. Range: [0, 1] under standard conditions; see 3.11 for anti-VIBE extension.

**3.5 VIBEMETER**
A conformant field instrument for the simultaneous measurement of all four sub-indices. Conformance requirements are specified in IOVS 1002.

**3.6 null VIBE state**
The condition in which VIBE = 0, corresponding to complete absence or total suppression of one or more sub-indices. Colloquially equivalent to "the vibes were off."

**3.7 maximum VIBE state**
The condition in which VIBE = 1.0, corresponding to all four sub-indices simultaneously at their maximum values. Colloquially equivalent to "it's a vibe."

**3.8 Bureaucracy-Induced Intimacy Surge (BIIS)**
An empirically observed transient elevation of the Intimacy sub-index (I) in high-Bureaucracy environments, attributed to shared adversity between co-present subjects. Designated a subject of ongoing standardisation; see IOVS 1005:2026 (draft).

**3.9 social temperature** *(T*soc*)*
A novel intensive quantity representing the mean kinetic energy of interpersonal exchange per unit social mass within a given social environment. Unit: J·kg⁻¹·soc⁻¹. See Clause 6, Note 2.

**3.10 VIBE Hamiltonian** *(H*VIBE*)*
The operator expression used in the full analytical derivation of the composite VIBE score. See Clause 6.2.

**3.11 anti-VIBE state**
A condition in which one or more sub-indices takes a negative value, indicating active suppression of the corresponding dimension rather than mere absence. Anti-VIBE states are outside the scope of the current edition; see IOVS 1005:2026 (draft).

---

### 4. Sub-Index Definitions

#### 4.1 Vibrations (V)

The Vibrations sub-index measures the total vibrational energy density of the social environment, integrating contributions from the acoustic, photonic, atmospheric, and micro-seismic channels of the VIBEMETER, together with the output of the X-Factor Receptor™ (XFR) channel.

V = 0 denotes total energetic quiescence. V = 1 denotes the maximum vibrational richness as defined by the VIBEMETER calibration reference (see IOVS 1002, Clause 7).

The XFR channel specification is maintained under separate cover pending resolution of applicable intellectual property restrictions. Operators SHALL use a conformant VIBEMETER (IOVS 1002) to ensure correct XFR integration.

#### 4.2 Intimacy (I)

The Intimacy sub-index measures the aggregate interpersonal and neurophysiological proximity coefficient of co-present subjects, integrating outputs from the infrared thermometry, BrainSync™ optical probe, galvanic skin response, respiratory coherence, and Semantic Proximity Analyzer™ (SPA) channels of the VIBEMETER.

I = 0 denotes complete social isolation. I = 1 denotes maximum interpersonal coherence as defined by the VIBEMETER calibration reference.

The SPA channel quantifies the ratio of expressed speech to demonstrably withheld speech ("words unsaid") via contextual gap analysis. Operators SHALL NOT prompt subjects in ways that alter the natural ratio of expressed to withheld speech during a measurement session.

#### 4.3 Bureaucracy (B)

The Bureaucracy sub-index is operationalised as the **inverse regulatory burden coefficient**. B = 1 represents the complete absence of institutional constraint within the social environment. B = 0 represents total bureaucratic saturation.

**NOTE:** This inversion is normative. High B scores indicate high freedom from institutional constraint and therefore high vibe potential in the Bureaucracy dimension. Low B scores indicate high regulatory burden and correspondingly suppressed vibe potential. Reporting VIBE data without noting this inversion is a non-conformance under IOVS 1004.

#### 4.4 Entropy (E)

The Entropy sub-index measures the entropic richness of the social environment — the availability and complexity of affective-informational states accessible to co-present subjects. E is derived from the normalised information entropy of the composite ambient signal (Shannon, 1948; Boltzmann, 1877; Clausius, 1865) as measured by the VIBEMETER, integrated with the output of the Ennui Quotient™ (EQ) instrument.

The EQ is a single-item self-report instrument administered to co-present subjects: *"How bleh do you feel right now?"* (response options: 1 = not at all; 5 = profoundly). EQ scores SHALL be standardised before integration into the E channel. In environments where subject self-report is not practicable, operators MAY omit the EQ channel, but SHALL note this omission in the measurement record under IOVS 1004.

E = 0 denotes a settled, affectively depleted environment. E = 1 denotes maximum emotional and informational complexity as defined by the VIBEMETER calibration reference.

---

### 5. Colloquial Reference Anchors

The following colloquial expressions are designated as normative reference points for VIBE index interpretation:

| Expression | Normative VIBE Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| "It's a vibe" | 1.0 | Maximum VIBE; all sub-indices at calibration ceiling |
| "Vibes were off" | 0.0 | Null VIBE state; see 3.6 |
| "Bad vibes" | < 0 | Anti-VIBE state; outside current scope; see IOVS 1005 |
| "The vibe is immaculate" | 0.90–1.0 | Informative only; not normative |
| "The vibe is off but manageable" | 0.15–0.35 | Informative only; not normative |

---

### 6. Composite VIBE Score

#### 6.1 Field Approximation

For standard field use, the composite VIBE score is computed as the geometric mean of the four sub-indices:

```
VIBE = (V × I × B × E)^(1/4)
```

This formulation ensures that any sub-index value of zero produces a composite score of zero, consistent with the null VIBE state (3.6). The VIBE score admits no partial credit across dimensions.

#### 6.2 Complete Analytical Expression

The complete analytical expression, derived from the Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical mechanical framework, is:

```
VIBE = Z⁻¹ · exp(−β · H_VIBE)
```

where:
- `H_VIBE = −(1/4) Σᵢ ln(φᵢ)` is the VIBE Hamiltonian (3.10) over the four sub-indices φ ∈ {V, I, B, E}
- `β = (k_B · T_soc)⁻¹` is the inverse social temperature (3.9), with k_B the Boltzmann constant
- `Z` is the VIBE partition function normalising across all accessible microstates of the system

**NOTE 1:** Under standard social conditions, the complete analytical expression reduces to the geometric mean given in 6.1.

**NOTE 2:** The social temperature T_soc is a novel intensive quantity introduced in this edition. Its determination is specified in IOVS 1003:2024, Annex C (normative). Standard social conditions are defined as T_soc ∈ [0.4, 0.8] on the normalised social temperature scale.

### 7. Calibration Reference

Prior to each measurement session, the VIBEMETER SHALL be calibrated against an approved reference vibe source. The IOVS maintains a list of approved reference vibe sources. At time of publication, the approved reference vibe source is the **IOVS Reference Social Environment Type 3 (RSE-3)**: a standardised configuration consisting of seven to nine persons gathered in a domestic kitchen environment on a weekend afternoon, with at least one window open and no institutional paperwork present.

Operators MAY petition IOVS for approval of alternative reference vibe sources by submitting Form IOVS-CAL-01 with supporting measurement data. Processing time: 90–180 days.

# About IOVS

## Mission

The International Organisation for VIBE Standardisation (IOVS) exists to ensure that anyone, anywhere, measuring a vibe — whether in a research setting, an industrial application, or a consumer context — is measuring the same thing in the same way with the same result.

We believe that the integrity of global VIBE data depends on the existence of rigorous, consensus-based standards. We believe that measurement without standardisation is merely opinion. And we believe — because the data compels us to — that vibes are real, quantifiable, and too important to leave to guesswork.

---

## History

The IOVS was founded in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2022, following the First International Conference on Affective Thermodynamics (VIBE-CON I), at which a working group of researchers and practitioners identified an urgent need for harmonised measurement standards in the emerging field of VIBE science.

The organisation's inaugural Technical Committee, TC-VIBE, produced the first edition of IOVS 1001 and IOVS 1002 in 2023. Following the introduction of the VIBEMETER Mark II and the publication of Goodvibe et al. (2026), both standards were revised and reissued in their current 2025 editions.

IOVS became a permanent observer organisation to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Working Party on Social Energetics in 2024.

---

## Governance

IOVS is governed by a General Assembly of member organisations, which meets annually. Day-to-day operations are managed by a Secretariat based in Geneva.

**IOVS | Glossary**

# Glossary of VIBE Terms

*This glossary is informative. Normative definitions are found in IOVS 1001:2025, Clause 3. In the event of conflict, the normative text prevails.*

---

**affective-thermodynamic state**
The composite condition of a social environment with respect to its Vibrations, Intimacy, Bureaucracy, and Entropy dimensions. Quantified by the VIBE index.

**anti-VIBE state**
A condition in which one or more VIBE sub-indices takes a negative value, indicating active suppression rather than mere absence of the relevant dimension. Theoretical basis under development; see IOVS 1005:2026 (draft). Colloquially: "bad vibes."

**Bureaucracy-Induced Intimacy Surge (BIIS)**
An anomalous transient elevation of the Intimacy (I) sub-index observed in high-Bureaucracy environments, attributed to bonds formed between co-present subjects through shared adversity. First documented in Goodvibe et al. (2026).

**calibration reference**
The approved environmental configuration against which a VIBEMETER is zeroed and scaled before use. Currently: IOVS Reference Social Environment Type 3 (RSE-3). See IOVS 1002:2025, Clause 7.

**composite VIBE score**
The single scalar value, VIBE ∈ [0, 1], representing the aggregate affective-thermodynamic state of a social environment. Computed as the geometric mean of V, I, B, and E under standard conditions.

**ennui**
A state of high personal entropy combined with low ambient social entropy, producing a characteristically listless, dissatisfied affect. Measured via the Ennui Quotient™ (EQ). High personal ennui is scored at the upper end of the 5-point EQ scale ("profoundly"). See also: *entropic richness.*

**Ennui Quotient™ (EQ)**
A single-item self-report instrument administered to co-present subjects during VIBE measurement: *"How bleh do you feel right now?"* (1 = not at all; 5 = profoundly). EQ output is integrated into the Entropy (E) sub-index.

**entropic richness**
The availability and complexity of affective-informational states accessible to co-present subjects in a given social environment, as measured by the Entropy (E) sub-index. Distinguished from thermodynamic entropy per se; see IOVS 1001:2025, Clause 4.4.

**inverse regulatory burden coefficient**
The operationalisation of the Bureaucracy (B) sub-index, in which high values indicate freedom from institutional constraint and low values indicate heavy regulatory burden. A deliberate and normative inversion; see IOVS 1001:2025, Clause 4.3, Note.

**IOVS**
International Organisation for VIBE Standardisation. The body responsible for the development and maintenance of VIBE measurement standards.

**null VIBE state**
VIBE = 0. Occurs when any sub-index equals zero, due to the multiplicative structure of the composite formula. Colloquially: "the vibes were off."

**social temperature** *(T*soc*)*
A novel intensive thermodynamic quantity representing the mean kinetic energy of interpersonal exchange per unit social mass. Introduced in IOVS 1001:2025. Unit: J·kg⁻¹·soc⁻¹.

**VIBE**
(1) As acronym: Vibrations, Intimacy, Bureaucracy, Entropy. (2) As noun (uncountable): the composite affective-thermodynamic state of a social environment. (3) As verb (informal, not standardised): to emit or embody a VIBE.

**VIBE half-life**
The theoretical interval over which a given environment's VIBE score decays toward its equilibrium value under the Second Law of Thermodynamics, absent active intervention. First proposed as a research direction in Goodvibe et al. (2026). Not yet standardised.

**VIBE Hamiltonian** *(H*VIBE*)*
The operator expression H_VIBE = −(1/4)Σᵢ ln(φᵢ) used in the complete analytical derivation of the VIBE index from its sub-components. See IOVS 1001:2025, Clause 6.2.

**VIBEMETER**
A conformant instrument for the simultaneous field measurement of all four VIBE sub-indices. Minimum requirements specified in IOVS 1002. The current reference implementation is the VIBEMETER Mark II (Bration, 2024).

**VIBEMETER CONFORMANT™**
A designation awarded by IOVS to instruments that have passed conformance testing under the VIBEMETER Conformance Programme (VCP). See [Certification →](/certification).

**words unsaid**
The demonstrably withheld portion of a subject's potential speech, as estimated by the Semantic Proximity Analyzer™ (SPA) channel of the VIBEMETER via contextual gap analysis of ambient discourse. Integrated into the Intimacy (I) sub-index. Operationalisation: see IOVS 1002:2025, Clause 4.2.

**X-Factor Receptor™ (XFR)**
The fifth channel of the VIBEMETER Vibrations (V) group, which captures residual vibrational signal not accounted for by the acoustic, photonic, atmospheric, or micro-seismic channels. XFR specifications are withheld pending patent resolution (XFR-2024-EU-00441). Conformance testing for XFR is performed by IOVS under separate cover.

# PAGE: /certification — Certification Programme
<!-- vibe-standards.org/certification -->

---

**IOVS | Certification**

# Certification & Accreditation

IOVS operates two certification programmes: the VIBEMETER Conformance Programme (VCP) for instrument manufacturers, and the Operator Accreditation Scheme (OAS) for individual measurement practitioners.

---

## VIBEMETER Conformance Programme (VCP)

The VCP enables manufacturers to certify that a VIBEMETER model meets the performance requirements of IOVS 1002. Certified models are awarded the **VIBEMETER CONFORMANT™** designation and are listed in the IOVS Approved Instruments Register.

### Conformance Levels

| Level | Description | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| **Level I — Basic Conformance** | Instrument meets minimum channel and range specifications | IOVS 1002, Clauses 4 and 5 |
| **Level II — Full Conformance** | Instrument meets all requirements including XFR and EQ integration | IOVS 1002, all clauses |
| **Level III — Reference Grade** | Instrument meets Level II and achieves stated precision across all reference environments | IOVS 1002 + Annex B testing |

The VIBEMETER Mark II (Bration, 2024) is certified at **Level III**.

### Application Process

1. Submit Form IOVS-VCP-01 with instrument technical specifications
2. IOVS technical review (30–60 days)
3. Laboratory testing at IOVS-accredited facility
4. XFR channel verification (IOVS, under separate cover; timeline subject to patent resolution)
5. Certification decision and listing in Approved Instruments Register

**Fees:**
- Application fee: CHF 2,400
- Laboratory testing: CHF 6,800–12,400 (depending on Level)
- Annual certification maintenance: CHF 980

---

## Operator Accreditation Scheme (OAS)

The OAS establishes competency requirements for individuals conducting VIBE measurements intended for publication, regulatory reporting, or commercial use. Accredited operators are listed in the IOVS Public Register and are authorised to certify that their measurements conform to IOVS 1003.

### Accreditation Requirements

Candidates for operator accreditation SHALL:

a) Demonstrate working knowledge of IOVS 1001, 1002, 1003, and 1004;

b) Complete a minimum of 40 hours of supervised measurement practice using a Level II or Level III conformant VIBEMETER;

c) Submit a portfolio of ten conformant measurement records from at least three distinct social context types;

d) Pass the IOVS Operator Competency Assessment (OCA), which consists of a written examination (120 minutes) and a practical field assessment conducted at an IOVS-approved assessment site.

**NOTE:** Candidates are reminded that the practical field assessment includes deployment in at least one high-Bureaucracy environment. IOVS recommends candidates review Annex A of IOVS 1003 (informative guidance on maintaining instrument and operator composure in B < 0.15 environments) before sitting the practical assessment.

### Accreditation Fees

- Written examination: CHF 420
- Practical field assessment: CHF 680
- Accreditation certificate (3-year validity): CHF 380
- Renewal: CHF 280

---

## Appeals

Applicants who disagree with a certification or accreditation decision may lodge an appeal in writing within 30 days of receipt of the decision notice, using Form IOVS-APPEAL-01. Appeals are reviewed by the IOVS Appeals Panel, which comprises three members not involved in the original decision. The Appeals Panel's determination is final.

Processing time for appeals: 60–180 days.

*IOVS notes that the appeals process itself has a measured Bureaucracy (B) sub-index of 0.11 and does not apologise for this.*

**IOVS | FAQ**

# Frequently Asked Questions

---

**Q: Are vibes real?**
Yes. See IOVS 1001:2025.

---

**Q: Can I measure my own vibe without a VIBEMETER?**
No. Self-reported VIBE estimates are not conformant with IOVS 1003 and SHALL NOT be represented as standardised VIBE measurements. However, an accessible consumer-facing VIBE estimator tool is available at [testyourvibes.com](https://testyourvibes.com). IOVS notes that consumer estimator results are indicative only and carry no certification status.

---

**Q: Why is Bureaucracy inverted?**
Because bureaucracy suppresses vibes, empirically and normatively. The inverse regulatory burden coefficient (B) is designed such that high B values contribute positively to the composite VIBE score, consistent with environments of high social freedom. This was a deliberate design decision and is not subject to appeal. See IOVS 1001:2025, Clause 4.3, Note.

---

**Q: Does the government waiting room really score a 0.178?**
Yes. Field data collected under IOVS 1003:2024 protocols across four international sites (Geneva, London, Tokyo, São Paulo) yielded a context mean of 0.178, driven primarily by a Bureaucracy sub-index mean of 0.083 — the lowest B̄ observed in the Goodvibe et al. (2026) study. This is the most thoroughly documented VIBE score in the literature.

---

**Q: What is Bureaucracy-Induced Intimacy Surge (BIIS)?**
BIIS is an anomalous transient elevation of the Intimacy (I) sub-index observed in high-Bureaucracy environments. It is thought to arise when co-present subjects form bonds through shared adversity. BIIS was first documented in the government waiting room context (Goodvibe et al., 2026), where four observations recorded I values of 0.532–0.699 against a context mean of 0.157. IOVS TC-VIBE/WG4 is developing guidance on BIIS identification and reporting; see IOVS 1005:2026 (draft).

---

**Q: What is the VIBE half-life and when will it be standardised?**
The VIBE half-life is a proposed constant describing the rate of VIBE decay in a fixed environment over time, under the Second Law of Thermodynamics. It was proposed as a research direction in Goodvibe et al. (2026). TC-VIBE/WG1 has added VIBE decay dynamics to its 2026–2028 work programme. A draft standard is expected no earlier than 2028.

---

**Q: What happens if a dog scores higher on Intimacy than the humans present?**
This is a matter of active investigation. Preliminary evidence from Goodvibe et al. (2026), Context 6 (dog park), suggests that canine subjects may be significant contributors to ambient Intimacy and Vibrations scores. TC-VIBE/WG5 is developing IOVS 1006 (Cross-Species VIBE). Pending publication of that standard, dogs are treated as subject-environment contributors to I and V but are not themselves scored.

---

**Q: The paper says vibes were "technically generated but not received" at the conference keynote. What does that mean formally?**
This refers to a boundary condition of the VIBE construct first noted in Goodvibe et al. (2026), in which ambient VIBE is produced (Vibrations and Entropy scores were non-trivial) but the density of co-present subjects approaches the theoretical minimum (n = 1 attendee). TC-VIBE/WG1 has proposed a "VIBE reception threshold" concept for inclusion in a future revision of IOVS 1001. No timeline has been confirmed.

---

**Q: What is the VIBE score of IOVS headquarters?**
IOVS does not comment on measurements taken at its own facilities. We refer enquirers to IOVS 1004:2024, which requires all conformant measurements to be reported to the Global VIBE Reference Dataset, where they are publicly accessible.

---

**Q: Is "social temperature" a real physical quantity?**
It is a novel intensive quantity introduced in IOVS 1001:2025 (2nd edition). Its dimensional analysis and unit definition are specified in Annex C of IOVS 1003:2024. Whether it is "real" in a deeper philosophical sense is outside the scope of IOVS standardisation activity.

---

**Q: I would like to dispute my VIBE score.**
Please see [Certification → Appeals](/certification#appeals). Form IOVS-APPEAL-01 is available on the [downloads page](/downloads). IOVS notes that initiating a formal appeal may itself affect the ambient B sub-index of the relevant measurement environment.

### Overall Aesthetic

The site should look like a slightly underfunded but deeply serious international standards body. Reference aesthetics: iso.org, ietf.org, nist.gov. Key qualities:

- **Colour palette:** White background, dark navy primary (#1a2744), slate grey secondary (#546e7a), minimal accent (single colour — consider a muted gold or teal for "current standard" badges)
- **Typography:** A sober serif for headings (Georgia or a free alternative like Playfair Display); a clean sans-serif for body (Inter or similar). NO quirky typefaces. Nothing that says "startup."
- **Logo:** IOVS wordmark — clean, institutional, no icons. Possibly a small abstract mark (a nested set of concentric measurement rings?). Should look like it was designed in 1994 and never updated.
- **Tone signal:** Dense. Real standards body websites are not designed for delight. Navigation is functional, not beautiful. Content is text-heavy. This is intentional.

### Key Interactive Elements

1. **Standards download flow** — locked behind a purchase/login wall. Free preview of first 3 clauses. PDF download after payment. CHF pricing displayed.

2. **Approved Instruments Register** — a table listing conformant VIBEMETER models with their certification level, certification date, and XFR status (most entries: "XFR — pending"). Should look like a real database table.

3. **Operator Accreditation Public Register** — a searchable table of accredited operators (fake names, affiliations, accreditation IDs). Accreditation IDs follow format: `IOVS-OAS-[YEAR]-[NNNN]` e.g. `IOVS-OAS-2025-0047`.

4. **Public Comment Portal** — for IOVS 1005:2026 draft. A simple form (Name, Affiliation, Clause reference, Comment text, 500-word limit). Comments to display publicly after moderation. Page should prominently display: "Public comment period closes 31 March 2026."

5. **VIBE Reference Dataset search** — link to GVRD (or redirect to testyourvibes.com). "Search conformant measurements by context, site, or date range."

### Tone Notes for Copywriters

- Every sentence should sound like it was approved by a subcommittee.
- Use SHALL, SHOULD, and MAY with RFC 2119 precision.
- Never use casual language. "Easy" does not exist. "Straightforward" does not exist. "Simple" does not exist.
- The one exception: the FAQ is permitted dry wit. See especially: "Q: Are vibes real? A: Yes. See IOVS 1001:2025."
- The note at the bottom of the Certification appeals section (*"IOVS notes that the appeals process itself has a measured Bureaucracy (B) sub-index of 0.11 and does not apologise for this"*) is the single moment of self-awareness on the entire site. It should be the only one.
- All copy should read as if written by someone who has spent a long time in a government waiting room and has made peace with it.
